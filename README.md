# LAMP PHP Smoke Test

A simple PHP smoke test application for DevOps training and automated deployment demonstrations.

## 📋 Purpose

This repository contains a minimal PHP application designed to verify that a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack is properly configured and operational. It serves as a teaching tool for DevOps courses, focusing on:

- **Automated Deployment**: Practice CI/CD pipelines and deployment automation
- **Infrastructure Testing**: Verify server configurations quickly
- **Environment Validation**: Confirm PHP and web server are working correctly
- **System Information**: Display key technical details about the deployment environment

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **DevOps Training**: Hands-on exercises for students learning deployment automation
- **Quick Health Checks**: Verify that a newly provisioned server is operational
- **Deployment Testing**: Confirm successful application deployments
- **Environment Debugging**: Identify configuration issues in LAMP stacks

## 📦 What's Included

The application displays:

- ✅ Visual confirmation that PHP is working
- **Hostname**: Server's hostname
- **Operating System**: OS type and kernel version
- **Server IP**: Server's IP address
